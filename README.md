# README for somc-subpages-Limewood
# Wordpress plugin test for Alten
# by Joakim Lindskog

The plugin consists of the PHP part (somc-subpages-Limewood.php), a css file (css/somc-subpages-Limewood.css) and a Javascript file (js/somc-subpages-Limewood.js). Additionally there are two images in the img folder, borrowed from sonymobile.com.

The Javascript uses jQuery extensively and has some simple animations for sorting and hiding/showing elements.

To collapse a sublist of subpages, click on the title of the parent subpage. Click again to expand it.

To sort a sublist of subpages, click on the grey area with the downwards pointing arrow below a parent subpage item. The arrow changes from pointing down to pointing up to indicate that the list is now sorted in descending order. Click again to sort ascending again.

To use the widget as a shortcode, put [somc-subpages-Limewood] on any Wordpress page.
